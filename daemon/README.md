# koad:io Daemon - Building Your Personal Kingdom

The koad:io Daemon is the linchpin for constructing your personal digital kingdom, offering command and control capabilities across a network of devices. Each device serves as a unique node in your realm, and the daemon empowers you to manage and orchestrate this kingdom.

## Key Features


### 1. Distributed Network

In your personal kingdom, each device is equipped with its own cryptographic identity. These identities create a secure and decentralized network, allowing devices to communicate and collaborate while preserving data integrity and confidentiality.

### 2. Entity Management

Within koad:io, entities represent distinct entities within your kingdom. These entities manage their own keyring and Merkle tree, which are fundamental to the security and functionality of your realm. The koad:io Daemon empowers you to oversee and govern these entities effortlessly.

koad:io leverages ZeroTier to establish isolated networks for each entity. This network isolation enhances security and streamlines communication, ensuring that each entity operates independently yet remains interconnected within your domain.
