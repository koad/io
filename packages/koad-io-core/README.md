This is basically an empty meteor package.

It includes other packages that would normally be included within the packages file


You can crate a new koad-io app
```
meteor create --bare src
```


then replace the contents of `.meteor/packages` with a simple `koad:io-core`

You can then add on more koad:io packages.


Most koad:io packages depend on this one.
