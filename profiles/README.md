# Profiles Directory

## Overview

The `profiles` directory is dedicated to storing data directories (`datadirs`) used by third-party applications. This setup allows for the segregation and management of different application profiles within the koad:io ecosystem.

## Structure

- **Browser Profiles**: Includes subdirectories for different browsers like Brave and Chrome. Each of these contains `app_id` folders with sandboxed browser data directories.
- These data directories are utilized to provide isolated environments for specific applications, enhancing both security and customization.

## Usage

To understand how to utilize these profiles, especially for browser-related tasks, refer to the documentation in the `commands/browse` folder. This will guide you on leveraging these profiles for specific commands and tasks within koad:io.
