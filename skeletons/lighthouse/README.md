# Lighthouse Skeleton

The `lighthouse` skeleton located at `~/.koad-io/skeletons/lighthouse` is a backend-focused component of the koad:io ecosystem designed for public internet deployment. It provides essential infrastructure for secure entity coordination and advanced workflow management via API/MCP interface.

## Overview

- **Keyserver Functionality:** Acts as a secure, public-facing keyserver to facilitate the discovery and exchange of cryptographic keys among entities.
- **MCP Workflow Tooling:** Supports Multi-Chain Protocol (MCP) workflows by enabling pub/sub event streams for real-time coordination and communication.
- **Daemon-Like Operation:** Runs headlessly as a daemon accessible over the internet, making it a central hub for distributed entities to connect, coordinate, and automate workflows.
- **Future-Proof:** Designed to accommodate future data flows and enhancements in decentralized entity management.

## Purpose

`lighthouse` serves as a coordination and communication backbone for entities that require:

- Secure key distribution and management
- Real-time event streaming and pub/sub communication
- Public availability to facilitate entity discovery and interaction

## Deployment

Deploy `lighthouse` as a standalone daemon on a publicly accessible server to enable your entities and users to connect, authenticate, and collaborate securely across distributed systems.

## Relation to Other Skeletons

Unlike the `interface` skeleton, which provides a PWA UI for administration and device management, `lighthouse` focuses purely on backend services and workflow orchestration without any user-facing interface.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Lighthouse skeleton, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A koad:io installation on your system.
- A koad:io-daemon running somewhere in your GAN/LAN

## Usage

To create a Lighthouse application using the Lighthouse skeleton, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred terminal or command-line interface.

2. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   alice generate lighthouse
   ```

   This command initializes the Lighthouse application in your `.alice/interace` folder based on the Lighthouse skeleton.

3. Once the initialization process is complete, navigate to the newly created `.alice/lighthouse` directory.

4. Customize the Lighthouse application by modifying the configuration files, adding or removing modules, and configuring services as per your requirements.

5. Start the Lighthouse application by running the following command:

   ```shell
   alice start lighthouse
   ```

   This command will launch the Lighthouse and make it available within your koad/io environment.

6. Access the Lighthouse through the appropriate user interface, such as a web-based dashboard or command-line interface, to manage and interact with the services and modules integrated into your Lighthouse application.

## Customization

The Lighthouse skeleton provides a foundation for building your Lighthouse application, but it can be further customized to suit your specific needs. You can modify the configuration files, add new modules or services, and configure them according to your requirements.

Additionally, you can explore the various features and capabilities of the Lighthouse, such as managing services, creating workflows, and integrating with external tools and systems. Leverage the power of the Lighthouse to orchestrate and streamline your koad/io environment.

## Conclusion

The Lighthouse skeleton simplifies the process of creating a Lighthouse application within your koad/io environment. By using the `alice init lighthouse` command, you can quickly set up a personalized Lighthouse instance in your `.alice` folder and customize it to meet your specific needs. Leverage the capabilities of the Lighthouse to manage services, coordinate modules, and enhance your productivity and collaboration within the koad/io ecosystem.
