# Lighthouse Skeleton

The Lighthouse skeleton provides a starting point for creating a Lighthouse application within your koad/io environment. This skeleton can be used to quickly set up and configure a Lighthouse instance in your personal `.alice` folder, allowing you to harness the power of the Lighthouse for managing and coordinating various services and modules.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Lighthouse skeleton, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A koad/io installation on your system.
- The `alice` entity set up and configured within your koad/io environment.

## Usage

To create a Lighthouse application using the Lighthouse skeleton, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred terminal or command-line interface.

2. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   alice init lighthouse
   ```

   This command initializes the Lighthouse application in your `.alice` folder based on the Lighthouse skeleton.

3. Once the initialization process is complete, navigate to the newly created `.alice/lighthouse` directory.

4. Customize the Lighthouse application by modifying the configuration files, adding or removing modules, and configuring services as per your requirements.

5. Start the Lighthouse application by running the following command:

   ```shell
   alice start lighthouse
   ```

   This command will launch the Lighthouse and make it available within your koad/io environment.

6. Access the Lighthouse through the appropriate user interface, such as a web-based dashboard or command-line interface, to manage and interact with the services and modules integrated into your Lighthouse application.

## Customization

The Lighthouse skeleton provides a foundation for building your Lighthouse application, but it can be further customized to suit your specific needs. You can modify the configuration files, add new modules or services, and configure them according to your requirements.

Additionally, you can explore the various features and capabilities of the Lighthouse, such as managing services, creating workflows, and integrating with external tools and systems. Leverage the power of the Lighthouse to orchestrate and streamline your koad/io environment.

## Conclusion

The Lighthouse skeleton simplifies the process of creating a Lighthouse application within your koad/io environment. By using the `alice init lighthouse` command, you can quickly set up a personalized Lighthouse instance in your `.alice` folder and customize it to meet your specific needs. Leverage the capabilities of the Lighthouse to manage services, coordinate modules, and enhance your productivity and collaboration within the koad/io ecosystem.
