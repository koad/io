Certainly! Here's a README for your "bare" skeleton:

# Bare Skeleton

The **Bare Skeleton** is a minimal starting point for your projects using koad:io. It provides you with the essential structure to kickstart your development. This skeleton is ideal for those who want a clean slate to build their projects from the ground up.

## Getting Started

To use this skeleton, make sure you have [koad:io](https://github.com/koad/io) installed and an entity to use it with (ie: `alice`:

Once you have koad:io installed, you can create a new project folder to use the Skeleton within:
```
mkdir ~/Workbench/a-new-super-dope-project
cd ~/Workbench/a-new-super-dope-project
```

Then can use alice to spawn the skeleton within
```bash
alice spawn bare
```

This command will deploy the Bare Skeleton into your current working directory. You can then start building your project on top of this minimal foundation.

## What's Included

The Bare Skeleton includes the following:

- A basic Meteor app structure in the `src` directory.
- A simple routing configuration in `src/both/router.js`.
- An empty template file in `src/client/templates.html`.
- An empty CSS file in `src/client/styles.css`.
- An empty application logic file in `src/client/application-logic.js`.
- An empty `head` tag in `src/client/head.html`.
- `.env` file with default configuration settings.
- Config files for device-specific settings in the `config` directory.
- A `README.md` file to help you get started.

## Next Steps

Once you've created your project using the Bare Skeleton, you can start adding your code, templates, and assets to build your custom application. You have the flexibility to shape your project according to your specific needs.

Refer to the [koad:io documentation](https://github.com/koad/io) for more details on using koad:io to manage your project.

Happy coding!
