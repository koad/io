# `koad:io` — Synthetic Intelligence Command Set

> ⚠️ **None of these commands are guaranteed to work. Many are broken. Many are placeholders.**
> That’s the point.

This is **not** a package of ready-made solutions.

This is a **template of intent** — a scaffold for your own **synthetic intelligence layer**, built with your hands, for your mind.

> You don’t want pre-built automation.
> You want *trustworthy*, *inspectable*, *self-made* tools.

## ❌ Blind Trust is a Threat

Copying someone else's command set without deep understanding is a risk:

* 💀 **Data loss**
* 🕵️ **Credential theft**
* 😳 **Public embarrassment**

Don't blindly import.
**Craft. Every. Command. Yourself.**

## 🧪 Learn from the Structure

What you see here is **an example** — a vision of how an information-worker might organize control over their digital environment.

Use it to:

* Study naming conventions
* See how environment scoping works
* Understand lifecycle states and modular design

Then: **discard or rewrite everything** until it's truly yours.

---

## 🧠 Curate Your Cheat Set

Treat each command like a personal artifact — a distilled solution from lived experience.

* Don’t clutter your interface.
* Be precise.
* Stay sovereign.

You are not scripting.
You are encoding your process.
