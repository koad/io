To make use of this init command, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone a koad:io entity repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine. You can use the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/koad/alice.git ~/.alice
```

2. Initialize Alice as an existing koad:io entity.  koad-io will assume Alice exists in the `~/.alice` folder.
